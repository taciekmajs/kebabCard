# KebabCards API

Unfortunately my Azure subscription expired, in order to test app You'll need to use PostgreSQL  
Make sure your `appsettings.json` file contains a valid PostgreSQL connection string, then run Update-Database with Package Manager Console, which should create a local database for kebab cards.  
Once You run API it's possible to test app with Swagger or client app.  
When running the project locally for the first time, a **default admin account** will be created automatically by the database seeder.
